# Useful Programs

What is a "program"? For the duration of this document, a 'program' is any software which aids users in effectively and efficiently performing basic routine daily tasks. While this software recommendation list may serve as valid technological suggestions, they are poor substitutes for properly addressing implementation strategy and/or developing consistent, documented user behaviors/workflows.

Additionally, items listed here will require more structuring in future revisions.

__NOTE:__ This section will include full programs (not libraries or programming languages)
