## Abstract

This section will demonstrate the preferred method for setting up a local development environment for Docker. The methods used rely upon the __Docker Community Engine__ and __Docker Compose__ for multi-container orchestration.

## Getting Started

### Docker Community Edition

Follow the instructions listed for your system's distribution to install the [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

The process may involve adding the docker community package repository sources to the system and installing the necessary packages. Optionally, various docker packages are provided by operating system maintainers, though they may vary from the official docker project packages or provide older releases.

### Docker Compose

Docker compose is typically installed while performing the installation for Docker Community Edition above.
